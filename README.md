# rasa_chatbot
NLP based chatbot for ordering food.
RASA – X integration to enable Local/Global API to access Organization( Trisha’s Kitchen for the demonstration purposes)

Step 1 - After creating the data files required to run the food ordering service on rasa successfully; few functionalities were added to enhance the chatbot, namely:
•	Payload buttons
•	Image URL

Step 2 – Installed Rasa X GUI, which helps in iterative learning through conversations. Trained the model with different scenarios and updated the ‘stories.yml’ file.

Step 3 – Deployed the rasa chatbot locally using Rasa API service on localhost, which runs on port 5005.

Step 4 – Created a web page using HTML, CSS and Java Script to provide locally hosted GUI for the chatbot. 

Step 5 - Now, for deploying the chatbot globally, which will enable us to have conversation with the chatbot anytime and on any device. A server was rented through Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Rasa X was installed onto the cloud server (which at this moment is empty and without any data).

Step 6 – Uploaded my Rasa project onto the GitHub repository, and using the SHH key added the GitHub project on the already installed Rasa X on the cloud server. 

Step 7 -  The cloud server Rasa X has now the data for food ordering service chatbot, which can be shared to guests via shareable link through which guests will be able to have conversation with the bot and help with public testing.
